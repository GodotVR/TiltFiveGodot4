README

  The Tilt Five native development kit enables development of content for the
  Tilt Five platform.

GETTING STARTED

  API documentation is provided in the 'docs' directory. Refer to the content
  there for details on how to use the API.

  Once you're familiar with the API, developing for Tilt Five is as simple as
  including the appropriate header from the 'include' directory, and packaging
  the appropriate library from the 'lib' directory with your application.

  Native C headers are provided by including 'TiltFiveNative.h' (C11 required).
  To use the C++ wrapper, include 'TiltFiveNative.hpp' (C++11 required).

  The native library can be dynamically loaded or linked.

SAMPLES

  The `samples` directory in the NDK download contains three trivial clients
  exercising a range of functions of the NDK. The two files `sample.c` and
  `sample.cpp` use the C and C++ interface respectively.
  They have been tested with GCC 11.2.0, clang 13.0.0-2, and MSVC 19.30.30705,
  built as follows:

  - `gcc -std=c11 sample.c -I .. ../lib/linux/x86_64/libTiltFiveNative.so`
  - `g++ -std=c++11 sample.cpp -I .. ../lib/linux/x86_64/libTiltFiveNative.so -latomic`
  - `clang -std=c11 sample.c -I .. ../lib/linux/x86_64/libTiltFiveNative.so`
  - `clang++ -std=c++11 sample.cpp -I .. ../lib/linux/x86_64/libTiltFiveNative.so -latomic`
  - `cl /std:c11 sample.c /MD /I .. ..\lib\win\x86_64\TiltFiveNative.dll.if.lib`
  - `cl /std:c++14 sample.cpp /MD /EHsc /I .. ..\lib\win\x86_64\TiltFiveNative.dll.if.lib`
